small note: it's a bit confusing that you have directories '01_lex' and
'01_lexer'. If you need extra data, you can create a subdirectory under
the pre-created submission directories.

another small item: the spec defines that your program should 
start when 'python3 main.py' is executed.

code is quite clear, some parts might benefit from more
explanations (COMMENT-state for example).
Your 'reserved' dictionary contains quite a lot of items which are 
not defined in the POPLang spec.

document is ok and answers to all questions.
"The compilation is done after lexical analysis when..."
this is a bit misleading or too generic, 
since there are several phases in the compilation 
process after the lexical analysis...

running the lexer with empty input shows debug-messages and a warning:
WARNING: Token 'END' multiply defined

Errors are exceptios with a trace. Quite pythonic way to do it, but
the spec talks about printing an error message.

Invalid date will generate two exceptions:
...
ValueError: time data '9999-99-01' does not match format '%Y-%m-%d'
...
During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
...
Exception: Illegal date format at line '2'

all these things are minor, so
phase 1 is accepted
